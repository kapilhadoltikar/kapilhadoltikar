**🚀 Backend Software Engineer | Java & Distributed Systems | Cloud-Native | Immediate Joiner**

I am a Java 21 enthusiast focused on building production-grade, cloud-native architectures. My work centers on bridging the gap between high-level application logic and low-level system performance.

Core Focus:

⚡ Native Performance: Leveraging GraalVM Native Image for sub-second startup and optimized cloud density.

🧵 Modern Concurrency: Utilizing Java 21 Virtual Threads (Loom) to scale I/O-heavy microservices.

🏗️ Resilient Systems: Implementing Event Sourcing (Kafka) and high-availability patterns (Read/Write splitting).

🛡️ Security: Designing PCI-DSS compliant vaulting and authenticated encryption (AES-256-GCM).

Current Focus: Perfecting the "Dual-Runtime" strategy to reduce cloud infrastructure costs while maintaining peak JIT throughput.
